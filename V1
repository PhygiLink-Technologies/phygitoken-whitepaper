### **1. Introduction**

Phygitoken (\$PHYG) is the native utility token powering the Phygilink ecosystemâ€”a blockchain-based platform that bridges the gap between physical collectibles and verifiable digital ownership. As Web3 evolves, the demand for secure and transparent collectible authentication grows. Phygilink provides a seamless system to link real-world items with NFTs via NFC-enabled tags, with \$PHYG serving as the digital fuel behind it all.

### **2. Purpose of \$PHYG**

\$PHYG is not a meme or speculative token. It is a real utility token designed for:

* Authenticating and verifying physical collectibles.
* Powering NFT upgrades and enhanced metadata.
* Unlocking exclusive drops, collectible fusions, and community perks.
* Facilitating future discounts and ecosystem benefits inside the Phygilink Marketplace.

### **3. Why Base?**

The Base network (an Ethereum Layer 2) was selected for its low fees, developer ecosystem, Coinbase integration, and ease of use for crypto-savvy collectors. Deploying on Base allows \$PHYG to remain affordable, scalable, and accessible to a growing Web3 user base.
